# CLIJx-Incubator - let your image processing workflows grow
[CLIJx-Incubator](https://clij.github.io/incubator) is an intuitive user interface for building custom GPU-accelerated image processing workflows using [CLIJ2](https://clij.github.io) in [Fiji](https://fiji.sc).

CLIJx-Incubator is under development and its API is subject to change. Please treat everything with care.
Do not use it for routine research yet. Planned release is early 2021. Stay tuned.

## Instant feedback
You can fine tune parameters of your workflow while inspecting different z-planes or time points of your data set and see results instantly.
