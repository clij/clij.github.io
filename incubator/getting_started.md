# Getting started CLIJx-incubating image processing workflows
Open your 3D+channel+time data set. Consider opening it as [virtual stacks](https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/docs/guide/146-8.html)
if it's huge. Afterwards, activate CLIJx-Incubator by clicking on its tool icon.

## Building workflows - step by step
CLIJx-Incubator has a built-in suggestions of what to do next: 
Just right click in any image that has been incubated.

Consider the suggestions but also explore the cateories of all available operations.

You also find all CLIJx-Incubator operations in Fijis search bar.

## Interoperabilty with classical ImageJ and Fiji operations
As CLIJx-Incubator runs in classical ImageJ windows, you can use ImageJ operations on the shown images. 
However, they may be overwritten as soon as CLIJx-Incubator recomputes its results.
Thus, it is recommended to duplicate an image before applying classial functions to it. 
You can use ImageJs `Duplicate...` menu or the built in menu:
