## Building workflows - step by step
CLIncubator has a built-in suggestion system analysing common CLIJ workflows to make suggestions of what to do next.

## Instant feedback
You can fine-tune parameters of your workflow while inspecting different z-planes or time points of your data set and see results instantly.

## Exporting workflows as ImageJ Macro
After you finished designing your image analysis workflow, you can export an ImageJ macro and apply it to image sequences systematically.
