## How to apply filters to your data
Open your data set. [Start the CLIncubator](https://clij.github.io/clincubator/getting_started). 
To configure the filter of your choice with the optimal settings, also activate following processing steps, 
such as thresholding. Instant feedback allows you to study consequences of different parameter settings.
