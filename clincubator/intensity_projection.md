# Intensity projection
CLIncubator has these intensity projections in Z available:
* Maximum Z Projection
* Minimum Z Projection
* Mean Z Projection
* Mean Z Projection of pixels above a given threshold
* Median Z Projection
* Standard Deviation Z Projection

You can increase contrast in visualisation of your sample by executing [background subtraction](https://clij.github.io/clincubator/filtering) in advance.

## How to apply an configure drift correction
Open your time lapse data set. [Start the CLIncubator](https://clij.github.io/clincubator/getting_started) and follow these steps:

* Your dataset
  * CLIncubator Starting point
    * Background subtraction
      * Maximum Z Projection
